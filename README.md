Objective: Learn the basics of FPGA hardware, understand Nexys2 board features, and practice first VHDL design flow.
Skills Covered: FPGA architecture, Nexys2 pinout, Xilinx ISE environment, basic VHDL coding.
Description: This lab introduces FPGA design methodology. Students explore the Nexys2 board, learn about switches, LEDs, and input/output configuration, and create their first VHDL project. The focus is on familiarization with the design environment and compiling a simple logic design.
